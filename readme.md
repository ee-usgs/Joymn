# Java On Your Mac Now (Joymn)

A set of scripts to configure a Mac computer for Java software development.
This script first does some configuration that most developers would want, and does some initial software installation:
- Configures Finder to always display hidden files (i.e. files that start with a dot)
- Installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as a package manager
- Installs [SdkMan](https://sdkman-native.github.io) as a Java SDK manager (it can also manage much more)
- Sets needed permissions and paths for Homebrew and SdKMan to work correctly

Using those two managers, it installs several other tools.
